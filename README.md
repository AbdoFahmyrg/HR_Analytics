## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee data to understand patterns and factors
influencing employee retention and attrition. The analysis is conducted using the   HR 
Analytics dataset, leveraging Tableau to extract insights and make data-driven decisions.

## Objectives 
• Understanding Retention Trends: Identify the key factors contributing to employee
turnover. 
• Employee Satisfaction Analysis: Assess the relationship between employee job
satisfaction, work-life balance, and retention. 
• Predictive Insights: Use data to forecast potential future trends in employee
retention. 

## Dataset 
• Name: HR Analytics 
• Description: The dataset contains various attributes related to employees,
including demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, and compensation details. 
Tools & Technologies 
• Tableau: Used for data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.
 
## Key Analyses 
• Retention Analysis: Study the factors influencing employee retention or turnover. 
• Satisfaction Correlations: Analyze the relationship between job satisfaction,
environment satisfaction, and employee attrition. 
• Income and Attrition: Investigate how salary and compensation relate to employee
turnover. 

## Here are some potential solutions to the problems identified in the findings:

- High Churn Rate (26.85%):
Solution: Implement customer retention strategies such as loyalty programs or targeted offers for high-risk customers.

- Customers Transitioning to Competitors:
Solution: Investigate reasons for switching to competitors (such as pricing or offers) and enhance the value of services provided.Highest Churn Rate in California (CA):

- Highest Churn Rate in California (CA):
Solution: Analyze the specific issues in California, such as coverage or pricing, and provide localized offers to address these concerns.

- Older Age Groups (65+) Show Higher Churn Rates:
Solution: Tailor offers and services for this demographic, such as flexible payment plans or dedicated customer service.

- Group 6 Has the Lowest Churn Rate:
Solution: Expand successful retention strategies from Group 6 to other groups to improve their churn rates.

- Month-to-Month Contracts Show Higher Churn Rates:
Solution: Offer incentives for customers to sign longer-term contracts or provide discounts for customers committing to longer terms.

- Customers on Unlimited Data Plans Consume More Data but Are More Likely to Churn:
Solution: Monitor data consumption and offer tailored plans or improved service to meet the needs of high-data users.

- Higher International Activity Correlates with Increased Churn:
Solution: Provide international plans or special offers for customers with high international activity.

- Payment Methods and Month-to-Month Contracts Are Linked to Higher Churn Rates:
Solution: Encourage stable payment methods like direct debit or annual billing and offer additional benefits for customers who choose these methods.

- Frequent Customer Service Calls Are Linked to Higher Churn Rates:
Solution: Improve service quality and customer satisfaction to reduce the need for frequent calls and ensure quicker response times.

- Higher Additional Charges for Customers Who Consume More Data but Don’t Have Unlimited Plans:
Solution: Offer flexible data plans or discounts for customers who use high amounts of data but don't have unlimited plans.

These solutions can help reduce the churn rate and improve customer loyalty.
